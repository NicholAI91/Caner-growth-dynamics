Cancer Growth Dynamics

Cancer Growth Dynamics Model — Summary
This interactive model simulates tumor proliferation using the logistic growth equation:

Core Parameters:
	•	r (Proliferation Rate) — Speed of unchecked cellular division, mapped to Awareness Curvature in your framework
	•	K (Carrying Capacity) — Maximum tumor size constrained by nutrients/space, representing the Contradiction Density limit
	•	P₀ (Initial Size) — Starting tumor volume
Intervention Mechanism:
The model introduces a Therapy/Entropy factor that disrupts the growth curve by:
	•	Reducing effective carrying capacity (K) by up to 80%
	•	Dampening proliferation rate (r) by up to 20%
This maps treatment as an entropic intervention — introducing disorder into the structured growth pattern, forcing the system toward a lower equilibrium state.
Framework Connection:
The model operationalizes your Awareness-Entropy Duality in biological systems: unchecked awareness (proliferation) follows sigmoidal saturation until entropy (therapy) bends the trajectory, demonstrating that cancer dynamics conform to your Six-Law archetype of Sigmoidal Saturation with entropy as the geometric intervention point.
